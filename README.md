# Tissue annotator
A simple, scrappy tissue annotation GUI developed for use with Margin-Dx at Illinois. 

# Setup
Tested with Python 3.12, `pillow==11.2.1`, and `pandas==2.2.3`.

I recommend using a virtual environment. Assuming Python 3.12 is accessible from the command line as `python`, you can run the following.
```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python tissue_annotator.py
```
